# Codecool shop (sprint 2)

## Story

It's time to enhance the Online Shop, an online eCommerce web-application with Java.
Where users can not only browse products, add them into a Shopping Cart,
checkout items and make payments. But also can log in and see the abandoned shopping cart or order history.

> Did you know that the very first product on eBay was a broken laser pointer?
> If you don't believe, check their history: [eBay history](https://www.ebayinc.com/company/our-history/)

## What are you going to learn?

- how to log properly and why does it important
- how to use property files to have project settings separately
- writing tests and mocking out dependencies to ensure the correct functionality and gain confidence at future  modification
- using database to make the data persistent
- how to use the `DAO` design pattern in `Java`,
- refreshing SQL knowledge


# Codecool shop (sprint 1)

## Story

Everyone loves to buy and sell stuff but we need a shop for that! In this
project the goal is to build one the [most common type of websites on the
web](https://www.expertmarket.co.uk/web-design/different-types-of-websites): an
online eCommerce web-application, where users can browse products, add them into
a shopping cart, checkout items and make payments.

## What are you going to learn?

- how to create dynamic web pages in `Java` with `servlets`,
- how to use the `DAO` design pattern in `Java`,
- how to use the `Thymeleaf` templating engine.


## Tasks

1. Create a new sprint tab on the existing backlog. Last week you had a long list of stories, a few new stories this week.
    - The new items are added to the backlog
    - The team has created a sprint 2 plan based upon the unified backlog

2. As you will work in a new repository but you need the code from the previous sprint, add the `codecool-shop-2` repository as a new remote to the previous sprint's repository, then pull (merge) and push your changes into it.
    - There is a merge commit in the project's repository that contains code from the previous sprint

3. As a Developer, I want to cover the `ProductService` and any other Service objects with unit tests. So that I can safely change the implementation later.
    - All methods of the Services should be tested, independently from their DAO dependencies, using mocking.
    - Both "happy-paths" and "sad-paths" are tested.
    - At least 11 unit tests pass. 

4. As a Developer, I want to have proper log messages when any failure happens to make it possible to find any malfunction in the system and track back user complaints.
    - With the dependency management tool logging facade is put under the app. Maven is used to add SLF4J to the application as dependency.
    - All exceptions are logged with proper description message.

5. As an Operator of the Shop, I want the product data to be persistent. So that I can restart the application without loosing product data.
    - There is an empty PostgreSQL database called `codecoolshop`
    - There is an initializer script file `src/main/sql/init_db.sql`. When I run the script file then all of the empty tables are created that will store `Products`, `ProductCategories` and `Suppliers`.
    - When the page is loaded and DB is used, suppliers, product categories and products are loaded from the database via `ProductDao`, `ProductCategoryDao`and `SupplierDao`.

6. As a Developer, I want to read the DAO settings and DB connection parameters (url, database name, usr, pwd) from a config file so I am able to change the settings of the application on every environment without compiling again
    - Given that I have the config file `src/main/resources/connection.properties`
with the following structure (exact values can be vary)
```
url: localhost:5432
database: codecoolshop
user: postgres
password: postgres
dao: memory```
    - Application reads the dao type settings from the property file. When the setting is `memory` then memory dao implementations are used. When the setting is `jdbc` then JDBC dao implementations are used.
    - Application reads the DB settings from the property file. `JDBC Connection` is initialized based on these settings.

7. As an Operator of the Shop, I want to keep Order data safe and persistent, so that I won't loose money because of technical issues.
    - Given the User started a checkout process. Then ensure it saves all Order data into database (in each and every step, except cart).

8. As a User, I want to sign up (make a personal account) so that I can store Orders to my personal account.
    - there is a `Sign up` option on the website
    - it has a form with all the required fields:
- `name`
- `email`
- `password`
    - when the user submits the form with correct/valid information then ensure the system saves it's data as a new `User`
    - the system sends a welcome email after successful registration
    - When the User submits the form with incorrect/invalid information then ensure the program shows the same form with the incorrect data, and some description about the errors.

9. As a User, I want to able to login, so I can authenticate myself and access my personal data. I want to be able to logout so I can close my session.
    - There is a `Login` menu on the website
    - When the user chooses the "Login" menu
then ensure to provide a login form with the following fields:
- email address
- password
    - When the user submits the form with valid information then authenticate and give a new logged-in session to the User
    - When the user submits the form with invalid information then provide an error message
    - Ensure to provide a Logout option for loggend in users. When the user chooses the "Logout" option then reset the session and redirect back to the login form.

10. As a loggedin User, I want to see my Order history, so that I can see my previous Orders and follow their status.
    - There is an `Order history` menu item
    - provide a list with all the Orders of that user, with the following details:
- order date
- order status (checked / paid / confirmed / shipped)
- total price
- product list (with product name, price)

11. As a logged-in User, I want to save the current items of my Shopping cart so that I can order my selected Products later.
    - there is a `Save my cart` button (on the Shopping cart review page)
    - by clicking on this button the system saves the cart items into the database - for that loggedin User
    - Given that there is a User with a previously saved shopping cart. When the user finished the login process then ensure to refill the user's shopping cart with the saved items.

12. As a loggedin User, I want to save my billing and shipping info (to my personal account) so that I don't need to type these data all the time - during checkout.
    - there is a `Billing info` menu item
    - after clicking on the menu a provide a form where the user can fill in
the personal billing and shipping info (what is needed for the checkout)
    - Given there's a Shopping Cart review page. When I click on the "Checkout" button then ensure the system shows the pre-filled billing and shipping info on the checkout form.

## General requirements

- Advanced OOP concepts are used in the project: inheritance, there is at
least on abstract class, there is at least one interface implemented
1. As a Developer, I want to have a version-controlled project, where a webserver serves requests. So that I can start developing in a sandboxed environment.
    - Given I start up my Java web-application server, when I open `http://localhost:8888` in my browser, then ensure the server gives back an index page

2. As a User, I want to have an index page, where I can see the list of Products within a default Product Category, so that I can browse Products within that Category.
    - Given I have Products and a default Product Category in the application when I open the root url (`/`) then ensure I can see a list of Products with the following details: product title, description, image, price

3. As a User, I want to have an index page, where I can filter Products by Product Categories so that I can browse Products within any Category.
    - Given I have Products and Product Categories listed on the index page when I click on a Category's title then ensure it displays the Products only in the selected Category

4. As a User, I want to have an index page, where I can filter Products by Suppliers so that I can browse Products by Suppliers too.
    - Given I have Products and Suppliers listed on the index page when I click on a Supplier's name then ensure it displays the Products only for the selected Supplier

5. As a User, I want to have a Shopping Cart so that I can add products which I want to buy.
    - Given I have a Product list and the Products have an "Add to cart" button when I click on the "Add to cart" button then ensure it creates a new Order for storing cart data of the User and ensure it creates a new LineItem with the quanity (default: 1) and price (the price of the Product) and ensure it stores this data on the server
    - Given I have a Product list and the Products have an "Add to cart" button when I click on the "Add to cart" button then ensure the number of cart items is displayed in the Page header

6. As a User, I want to review my Shopping Cart so that I can review the items in my shopping cart before checking out so that I can see what I've already selected.
    - Given I have a Shopping Cart with items in it when I click on the "Shopping cart" menu item in the Page header then ensure it displays the items (LineItems) with the following data: name of the Product, quantity, unit price / subtotal price
    - Given I have a Shopping Cart with items in it when I click on the "Shopping cart" menu item in the Page header ensure the total price of all the items in the cart is displayed

7. As a User, I want to edit the items in my Shopping Cart so that I can modify the items when I change my mind - by changing quantity or removing items.
    - Given I have a Shopping Cart review page and the LineItems are displayed in a form and the quantities are displayed in input fields when I change the quantity of an item then ensure it stores the new quantity of the LineItem
    - Given I have a Shopping Cart review page and the LineItems are displayed in a form and the quantities are displayed in input fields when I change the quantity to 0 then ensure it removes the LineItem from the cart

8. As a User, I want to checkout the items from the Shopping Cart so that I can order the Products.
    - Given I have a Shopping Cart review page when I click on the "Checkout" button then ensure it asks the following data from the User: Name, Email, Phone number, Billing Address (Country, City, Zipcode, Address), Shipping Address (Country, City, Zipcode, Address)
    - Given I have a Shopping Cart review page when I click on the "Go to Payment" button then ensure Ensure that data on the checkout form are validated
    - Given I have a Shopping Cart review page when I click on the "Go to Payment" button and data are validated successfully then ensure that data on the checkout form are stored in the Order
    - Given I have a Shopping Cart review page when I click on the "Go to Payment" button and data are validated successfully then ensure that it redirects to the Payment page

9. As a User, I want to pay for my Products so that I can complete the payment online.
    - Given I checked out the items from the Shopping cart then I can see the total price what I have to pay
    - Given I checked out the items from the Shopping cart then I can choose from the following payment methods: credit card, paypal
    - Given I checked out the items from the Shopping cart and chosen the payment method then based on the selected payment method I can enter the credentials for the payment provider: card number, card holder, expiry date, code (in case of credit card), username and password (in case of paypal)

10. As a User, I want to see the result of my payment so that I can get a confirmation about my Order.
    - Given I made a payment and there was an error in the customer then I can see the details of the error
    - Given I made a payment and the customer was successful then I can see the Confirmation page with the details of the Order
    - Given I made a payment and the customer was successful then then ensure it saves the Order into a `JSON` file
    - Given I made a payment and the customer was successful then ensure it sends an email to the User about the Order

11. As an Admin, I want to have a logfile about the checkout processes (per Order) so that I can see the steps of every Order and investigate issues.
    - Given the User started a checkout process then ensure it saves all the steps and details into a JSON file (where the filename is the Order ID and Date)

## General requirements

- Advanced OOP concepts are used in the project: inheritance, there is at least on abstract class, there is at least one interface implemented
- The project keeps the three-layer structure: servlets handle HTTP, service objects handle business logic, and DAOs handle data access.
- The page doesn't show a server error anytime during the review
- All code is pushed to GitHub repository by atomic commits. The implemented feature related commits managed on separated feature branches and merged by a pull request to the `master` branch.

## Hints

- It's not required to integrate real payment services - you can use fake payment implementations.
- Use the DAO implementations via interfaces so that it will be easy to change the implementation behind the interface.
